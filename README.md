# ToTarGzConverter
A Small Programm that lets you  convert Multiple Folders into a single .tar.gz-File, while keeping the folder-strukture. 
Needs .net 4.0, no ther installations needed.

THIS IS LIKE A ALPHA, it works, but very little testing has been done.

InputPath: Path to where the Folders you want to convert are (all Folders you want to convert need to be in the same directory).
OutputPath: Path to where to .tar.gz-File will be outputted.
Name: Name of the .tar.gz-File, the ".tar.gz" will be added by the programm.
Then Check the Folders you want to convert and press "Convert to Targz".

You have one preset thats loaded when the program is started, it saves InputPath, OutputPath and Name.
