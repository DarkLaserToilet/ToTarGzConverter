# ToTarGzConverter
A Small Programm that lets you  convert Multiple Folders into a single .tar.gz-File, while keeping the folder-strukture. 
Needs .net 4.0, no ther installations needed, just put all the files in a seperate Folder and use the exe (there propably is a way to make that better, but i dont know it...)

THIS IS LIKE A ALPHA, it works, but very little testing has been done.

InputPath: Path to where the Folders you want to convert are (all Folders you want to convert need to be in the same directory).
OutputPath: Path to where to .tar.gz-File will be outputted.
Name: Name of the .tar.gz-File, the ".tar.gz" will be added by the programm.
Then Check the Folders you want to convert and press "Convert to Targz".

You have one preset thats loaded when the program is started, it saves InputPath, OutputPath and Name.

This is my first github-project and its less of a project and more something that i just made because it made my life easier.
If i get some Feedback or something, ill propably Improve this programm. Some Features could be:
  - more Saves and SaveSelect
  - a working Progressbar
  - selection of Folders in different directories, to convert into a targz
